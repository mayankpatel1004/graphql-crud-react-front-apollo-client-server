typeDefs - 
    The defination of our schema of what we can expect from queries and mutations.
Resolvers - 
    Instead of the expectation of fields or required parameters, here we define the functions and behaviours of how should the queries and mutations would work.
Queries -
    The "gets" that we want to read from the server.
Mutations - 
    Our requests that are going to affect any data that we have on our own server.
